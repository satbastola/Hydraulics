    "\n",
    "1. **What distinguishes inlet control from outlet control in culvert hydraulics, and why does it matter for culvert design?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Think about whether flow is limited by the entrance geometry or by what happens inside the barrel.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does Manning’s equation reflect the influence of pipe roughness, geometry, and slope in outlet-controlled culvert flow?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Pay attention to the role of the roughness coefficient \\( n \\), hydraulic radius \\( R \\), and slope \\( S \\).*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why does the governing control condition depend on the comparison between inlet and outlet discharge capacities?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Consider which component of the culvert system is more restrictive to flow under given conditions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When modeling inlet control, why are both weir and orifice equations used? What do they represent physically?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: It depends on whether the flow is free over the crest or fully submerged at the entrance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explain how culvert shape (circular vs. box) affects flow area and perimeter, and thus flow regime and velocity.**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Different shapes result in different hydraulic radii, affecting resistance and capacity.*\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 🔍 Reflective Questions (with Hints)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In mountainous terrain, which control (inlet or outlet) likely governs culvert flow, and why?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Think about high slopes, short culvert lengths, and swift approach flows.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How might debris accumulation at the entrance affect the accuracy of inlet control predictions?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Imagine how effective flow area and entrance geometry could change in practice.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If tailwater level increases over time due to downstream changes, what happens to the governing control assumption?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: A rising outlet depth could push the system into full-pipe flow conditions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why is it important to account for both frequent low flows and rare flood events in culvert design?**  \n",
    "   🔎 *Hint: Reliability and safety aren’t based on a single storm. Think resilience and serviceability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How might increased rainfall intensity due to climate change affect culvert sizing and design safety margins?**  \n",
